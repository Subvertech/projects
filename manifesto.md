### Ethos
#### Can technology be produced without exploitation?
#### Can technology be used to stop exploitation?
#### Can technology be used to reduce inequality?

The tech industry has been accelerating the growing gap between the rich and poor with algorithmic precision. Silicon Valley tech has been fueling gentrification in the Bay Area while [contract workers make up a majority of their workforce](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/22/silicon-valley-using-contract-employees-to-drive-profits.html), while further still providing solutions to help [automate people's jobs](https://www.geek.com/tech/study-25-percent-of-u-s-workers-at-risk-of-job-automation-1771497). The tech attitude to progress ("disruption") comes at a steep price: livelihoods at the bottom are being disrupted in order to [generate more wealth for those on top](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report).

Technology rules our lives and, for better or for worse, those who provide it receive the biggest cut. Some may raise the notion that that's completely fair, **"If I change how the world works in big ways, I can become powerful."** However, exploitation and abject wealth go hand in hand.
When wielded by the underprivileged, technology is powerful: empowering people by increasing access to opportunities for upward mobility and 
provide tools for equalizing the playing field. But wielded by those seeking incredible wealth, technology is exploitative: [automating and surveiling your livelihood](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook) so they can sell you more. It is time to rethink our relationship with technology. It is time to reconsider the 
societal impacts of our progressive web apps. It is time to reimagine the notion: **"We can make small changes to the world and make
someone else a little more powerful."**

### It is time to subvert tech.

**Subvertech** is a catch-all term to describe clever applications of technology that seek to uplift communities and reduce inequality.
There are countless, amazing people scattered around the world working on projects that rarely receive recognition for the work that they do but have
lasting impacts in the communities that they serve. This website is a tribute to their effort by increasing their visibility in hopes that you
consider contributing to them yourself.

### Subvertech in the short term:

For now, it's just a [Github repository](https://github.com/subvertech/projects) of projects that you can support and contribute to that embody the spirit of reducing income inequality (is it uncool to use Github now by the way?). This website is dynamically loaded with new contributions to the repository. There's also a page for scoping out future projects that "subvert" the way we think about what tech can do
to reduce income inequality.

### Subvertech in the long term:

I would love to see Subvertech grow into a platform for people to launch their awesome projects on a shared network of cheap computers. We often have to rely on cloud computing provided by big tech companies and share rackspace with disagreeable institutions. It would be unfortunate if your effort to reduce inequality inadvertently contributes back to the problem itself. The same problem carries into decentralized web architectures as well:
you would never know what kind of projects that your personal machine is contributing to. By designing into the system semantics for "agreeability,"
the load balancer can prioritize projects on your machine that you feel the most connected to. For now, let's just stick with the projects repository!

### One more (problematic) thing:

Humans are fundamentally flawed. Every institution has done something that they aren't proud of. Sometimes a project is funded
through morally questionable sources. Doing "good" in this world is messy and complicated. Of course, one should not ignore
these things simply because a project's mission is well-intentioned: often, it's impact will say something completely different.
But Subvertech is analog: every project with the goal of reducing inequality has some merit and deserve credit where credit is due.
Talk about what these projects do wrong to reflect on how we can do things better.
