# Welcome to Subvertech!
This is the repository that manages the content on [subvertech.org](subvertech.org). Subvertech is all about technology that fights income inequality. Read the manifesto here: [manifesto.md](manifesto.md)

The main pages of subvertech are as follows:
- [projects.md](projects.md): A repository of projects that embody the subvertech ethos to any degree.
- [organizations.md](organizations.md): A repository of organizations that use technology to subvert inequality.
- [new_project.md](new_projects.md): A repository of simple to radical project ideas that subvert the way you think about technology to fight inequality.

## Note
For now, any commits to this repository won't immediately reflect on the website until I manually rebuild, but I hope to automate this process using git hooks.
